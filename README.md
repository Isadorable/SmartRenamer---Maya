The purpose of this tool is to optimize the creation of rigs by speeding up the process of renaming large amounts of objects (e.g. long chains of joints).

Moreover, it can automatically create a customizable hierarchy of groups to organize the different elements of the rig. It can also automatically mirror chains of joints and rename them in a single click.
